excerpt: "First post of the blog wihch is just me explaining what frameworks i used to create this"
---

To create this blog I used many different frameworks and in this post I will be telling you what frameworks I used and why I chose them. I will also tell you why I created this blog! You can find the source code for this website on my GitHub and the repoistory is called portfolio.

# Frameworks Used

For the Blog I used next.js and the example i used blog-starter and modified it to fit my needs. I used tailwind css for siplicity and because I hate using css modules in next.js. Practical-js-utils cause it's my package and it's just one of the best packages hands down. Remark/Remark-html to convert the markdown to HTML. Post CSS to minimise the amount of unused css!

# Why I created this website

The main reason I created this website was mainly because I wanted to have a place where I could keep all my projects and maybe even documentation if its a project like pracitcal-js-utils!

# What to expect

You can probably expect for me to create posts at least once every two weeeks about a programming tutorial and  I will add documentation for some of my npm packages soon,  but don't expect for me to start right now because I am still building this site.

That's all for now and I will see you in the next Post!
